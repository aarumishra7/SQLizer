# SQLizer

## Overview

SQLizer is an innovative tool that leverages the power of generative AI, specifically the Gemini Pro model, alongside Python libraries and machine learning algorithms to convert natural language text into SQL commands. This project aims to simplify database interactions by allowing users to generate SQL queries through simple text instructions, making database management more accessible to those without extensive SQL knowledge.

## Key Features

- **Generative AI Integration**: Utilizes the Gemini Pro generative AI model to interpret and transform text into accurate SQL commands.
- **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Implements core machine learning principles to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of text-to-SQL conversion.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Built using PyTorch, a leading deep learning framework, ensuring robust performance and scalability.
- **Diffusion Models**: Applies diffusion models to improve the natural language understanding capabilities of the system.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Incorporates state-of-the-art LLMs to handle a wide range of text inputs and generate precise SQL commands.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for users with basic programming skills, lowering the barrier to database management and manipulation.
